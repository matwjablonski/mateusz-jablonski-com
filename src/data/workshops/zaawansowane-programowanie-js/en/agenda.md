### Secure and Efficient JavaScript Programming
- JavaScript language specification and standards
- Correct and efficient script loading strategies
- Debugging code in the browser
- Working in strict mode
- Proper declaration and usage of variables and constants
- Comparison operations and safe type coercion
- Functions, closures, and their practical applications
- Execution context, variable scope, and the role of `this`
- Object-oriented programming using the prototype-based model
- Mix-ins as an alternative to classical inheritance
- Exception handling

### Modern JavaScript (ES6/ES2015 and beyond)
- Code transpilation and cross-browser compatibility
- Arrow functions
- Function parameters (default values, spread, rest parameters)
- Template literals and string interpolation
- OOP: class declarations, class members, computed properties, inheritance, static members, getters/setters, access control
- Destructuring (objects, arrays, function parameters)
- Nullish coalescing
- Working with modules
- Symbols
- Generators and iterators
- Collections (Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet)
- Summary of major ECMAScript features and upcoming changes
